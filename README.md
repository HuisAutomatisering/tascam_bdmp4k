Control a **Tascam BD-MP4K** professional Blu-ray player from Home Assistant over its
Ethernet control protocol (TCP port 9030): transport control, disc and playback status,
elapsed and remaining time, menu navigation, and power on with Wake-on-LAN.

## Entities

All entities belong to one device, **Tascam BD-MP4K**.

| Entity | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Tascam BD-MP4K | Media player | Play, pause, stop, next/previous chapter, standby, and power on via Wake-on-LAN when a MAC address is set. Shows the position and the duration (elapsed + remaining time). Shows **off** when the player is in standby or unreachable. |
| Disc status | Sensor (enum) | No disc, disc present, unknown disc, tray open, tray closed, tray error. |
| Playback status | Sensor (enum) | Playing, paused, stopped, slow or search forward/reverse, and the menus. |
| Time elapsed / Time remaining | Sensor (duration, s) | Numeric, so they work in templates and statistics. Unknown when nothing plays. |
| Current chapter / Current title | Sensor | Chapter (or file) and title (or CD track) number. |
| Tray open / Tray close | Button | Disc tray. |
| Menu home, enter, return, top (disc), popup, setup | Button | Menu navigation. |
| Display info, Subtitle next | Button | On-screen info, next subtitle language. |
| Mute on / Mute off | Button | Audio mute. |
| Power off (standby) | Button | Puts the player in standby. |

Status changes pushed by the player, including ones made with its own remote control, appear
in Home Assistant straight away. Names are available in English and Dutch.

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)

Click the **Open in HACS** badge above, or
[this link](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=HuisAutomatisering&repository=tascam_bdmp4k&category=integration),
to open this repository in HACS on your own Home Assistant instance. Download it and
restart Home Assistant.

Adding it by hand works too:

1. In HACS, open the menu (three dots) and choose **Custom repositories**.
2. Add `https://github.com/HuisAutomatisering/tascam_bdmp4k` with type **Integration**.
3. Download **Tascam BD-MP4K** and restart Home Assistant.

### Manual

1. Copy `custom_components/tascam_bdmp4k` into the `custom_components` folder of your
   Home Assistant configuration.
2. Restart Home Assistant.

## Configuration

Go to **Settings → Devices & services → Add integration** and search for
**Tascam BD-MP4K**, or use
[this link](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=tascam_bdmp4k).

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Host | IP address or host name of the player. |
| Port | TCP control port. The player always uses 9030. |
| MAC address | Optional. Needed to switch the player on with Wake-on-LAN. |

The connection is tested before the entry is created. To switch the player on from Home
Assistant, also enable network standby / Wake-on-LAN in the player's own setup menu; without
it the player ignores the magic packet.

## How it works

The BD-MP4K protocol requires that the TCP connection stays open and accepts **only one
client** at a time. The integration keeps a single shared connection for all entities and
keeps the 30 ms minimum interval between commands from the specification.

Transport and disc changes are pushed by the player and processed immediately. A poll every
10 seconds is the fallback and reads the elapsed and remaining time, which the player does
not push.

## Limitations

- **Power on over Ethernet is not part of the protocol.** The specification prescribes
  Wake-on-LAN, which this integration uses when a MAC address is set.
- **Only one controller can be connected at a time.** Disconnect other control systems
  (Bitfocus Companion, Crestron and the like) while using this integration.
- The player answers `nack` to status requests that do not apply to its current mode, for
  example the remaining time while stopped. Those values show as *unknown*; that is normal.

## Troubleshooting

Enable debug logging to see every command, reply and notification:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.tascam_bdmp4k: debug
```

If the entities go unavailable now and then, the player was in standby, or another system
claimed its single client slot.

## Removal

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & services** and open **Tascam BD-MP4K**.
2. Open the menu (three dots) next to the entry and choose **Delete**.
3. To remove the files as well: in HACS, open **Tascam BD-MP4K** and choose **Remove**, or
   delete `custom_components/tascam_bdmp4k` for a manual installation. Restart Home
   Assistant afterwards.

Nothing is changed on the player itself.

## Quality scale

This integration is aligned with the **Bronze** tier of the
[Home Assistant integration quality scale](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/integration-quality-scale/).
Home Assistant only grades integrations that ship with Home Assistant itself, so this is a
self-assessment, not an official rating. The status per rule is recorded in
[`quality_scale.yaml`](custom_components/tascam_bdmp4k/quality_scale.yaml).

## Development

The tests use
[pytest-homeassistant-custom-component](https://github.com/MatthewFlamm/pytest-homeassistant-custom-component)
and run on every push. To run them locally (Python 3.14):

```bash
pip install -r requirements_test.txt
pytest --cov --cov-report=term-missing
```

Code style is checked with [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) (configuration in
`ruff.toml`); see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

A standalone Python client for the same protocol, independent of Home Assistant, is
available as [aiotascam](https://github.com/HuisAutomatisering/aiotascam).

## Security

The control protocol has no authentication or encryption. Keep the player on a trusted
network and never expose port 9030 to the internet. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
